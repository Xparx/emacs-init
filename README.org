* Emacs init setup
emacs-init is my highly personalized emacs setup repository inspired
and in part *kopied* from emacs24-starter-kit which can be fetched here:

http://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit/

emacs-init should be self contained as much as possible.

To try it out check out instructions [[file:emacs-init.org::#my-emacs-init][here]].
